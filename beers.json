          Description:'Every rail working in the shops or on the trains has to have lunch sometime. And what’s better for lunch than a good old fashioned peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

You wanted peanut butter, you got it. With jelly. And beer. 5.4% ABV, 15 IBU, 11 SRM. Contains peanuts and lactose.',
